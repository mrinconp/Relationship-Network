# Relationship Network

Relationship Network is a project to model real life relationships as graphs. Every node is a Person with full name, age, job and city attributes. The main goal behind this project was to implement Object Oriented Programming, Graph theory and Graph search algorithms such as DFS and BFS.

Use `run(graph_type, plot, animate)` to generate a graph, plot it and visualize search algorithms.

Use `graph_type = 'network'` for networks and `graph_type = 'tree'` for trees.

Use `plot = True` to see generated network

Use `animate= True` to visualize search algorithms
